(*If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.

{20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

For which value of p ≤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?*)



let check a b c = [(float a) / 3. ;  (float b) / 4.; (float c) / 5.]
